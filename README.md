The app displays a random character and location. Locations can be filtered by their loot type (High, Mid, Basic) with checkmarks. All characters and locations on all three maps are supported. The app updates as the game updates per season. System dark theme is supported. The color theme of the app corresponds with the color theme of the game season.

Additional features that could be added:
* Zooming into the map, which would zoom in on the marker as well
* Character blacklisting/whitelisting using a dialog window of checkmarks when pressing the character image (this is currently being worked on)
* Location blacklisting/whitelisting per loot tier (three buttons can be added above the checkmarks to filter certain locations, but these need to be saved per map so that when the user switches the map and back, data won't be lost)
* Saving a preset of both map location and character whitelist/blacklist selections so that when the user quits the app and comes back, the data will be preserved and not reset to default again)

Version system: x.y.z

* x = Season number
* y = Game patch number (only town takeovers are counted, starting at 0 before any additional patches, usually there is only one per season, so 1 would equal the first town takeover, 2 would be the second if there is one, etc.)
* z = App update number (this number starts at 1 and goes up for each update of the app released per game patch.)
