# ApexRandomApp

This is my first Android App! I learned all of this in a day on my own! It is the android implementation of ApexRandom. It displays a random character and location (depending on the RadioButton setting). There are plans to add images for each character that gets selected as well as the location being shown on a map image.

1. Download the APK here (text only version) ~2MB size, Requires Android 5.0 or greater -> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HSuoOJxm8IJ8K5EZd3NzrE_1lwdGjplX/view?usp=sharing



2. Tap "Allow installation of unknown apps" (or something like that) and it will run.
