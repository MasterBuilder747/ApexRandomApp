# ApexRandomApp

This is my first Android App! It displays a random character and location (depending on the RadioButton setting).

1. Download the APK here (locations on the map still need to be implemented) ~20MB size, Requires Android 5.0 or greater -> [v0.5](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17B06ULEWIIuad656IZpIaNigWkqe4Moy/view?usp=sharing)

2. Tap "Allow installation of unknown apps" (or something like that) and it will run. There are no system permissions.
